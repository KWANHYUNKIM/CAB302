#Requirements (5%)
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#3	3	Client requirements are comprehensively covered<br/>
#0	2	Client requirements are accurately prioritised (e.g. must have, should have, nice to have)<br/>
#Marker feedback: Missing priorities for each requirement.<br/>
#Total:	3 / 5<br/>

#Detailed Design (10%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#2	3	Public classes are comprehensively documented, and they appear sufficient to meet majority of client requirements<br/>
#Marker feedback: Some classes have javadoc descriptions, but methods are missing documentation.<br/>
#0.5	1.5	Interactions (method calls, parameter passing) between classes are documented<br/>
#Marker feedback: No high level class diagram.<br/>
#0.5	1.5	Design and dataflow of GUI forms are comprehensively described<br/>
#Marker feedback: No GUI workflow diagrams.<br/>
#0.5	2	An appropriate network protocol for the project is comprehensively described (sufficient information to create an alternate client/server)<br/>
#Marker feedback: Network protocol documentation is incomplete, it should show each of the requests, parameters, and expected responses.<br/>
#1.5	2	An appropriate database schema for the project is comprehensively documented (sufficient information to recreate)<br/>
#Marker feedback: A graphical ER diagram would make the relationship between tables clearer.<br/>
#Total:	5 / 10<br/>

#Unit Testing (10%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#0.5	4	Black box unit tests are present and cover normal cases and boundary cases<br/>
#Marker feedback: Unit tests do not actually 'test' anything - they are devoid of JUnit assertions and catch any exceptions, meaning they will never fail<br/>
#0.5	1	Black box unit tests are present and cover exceptional cases<br/>
#Marker feedback: As above<br/>
#0.5	3	Glass box unit tests are present and achieve total code coverage over the code that can be reasonably unit tested<br/>
#Marker feedback: As above<br/>
#0	2	Mock objects are used to replace real resources (e.g. database, network connection) for the purposes of unit testing<br/>
#Marker feedback: Could not see any evidence of mocks being used.<br/>
#Total:	1.5 / 10<br/>

#Implementation (10%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#2	4	Demonstrated software is working and covers all the client's must-have requirements<br/>
#Marker feedback: Can see some requirements implemented in code, but video does not show the software functioning.<br/>
#1	2	Demonstrated software is working and covers all the client's should-have requirements<br/>
#Marker feedback: See above.<br/>
#0	1	Demonstrated software is working and covers all the client's nice-to-have requirements<br/>
#Marker feedback: See above.<br/>
#2	2	Code quality is good, without need for refactoring<br/>
#0	1	Code is appropriately commented (referring to inline comments, not JavaDoc-style as these are marked within the detailed design)<br/>
#Marker feedback: Very few high level comments.<br/>
#Total:	5 / 10<br/>

#Integration (5%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#0.5	2	Build scripts that build the software and run unit tests are demonstrated<br/>
#Marker feedback: Build script does not do packaging, run unit tests or anything else.<br/>
#0	3	A continuous integration pipeline that builds the software and runs unit tests is demonstrated.<br/>
#Marker feedback: CI not demonstrated in video.<br/>
#Total:	0.5 / 5<br/>

#Individual contributions (5%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#1	1	Individual demonstrates that they contributed a fair portion of the work that went into the detailed design.<br/>
#0	1	Individual demonstrates that they contributed a fair portion of the work on developing unit tests.<br/>
#Marker feedback: No unit tests present.<br/>
#1	1	Individual demonstrates that they contributed a fair portion of the work on implementing the code.<br/>
#2	2	Individual demonstrates that they have a comprehensive understanding of the entire project.<br/>
#Total:	4 / 5<br/>

#Individual source control (5%)<br/>
#Marks	Total	Criterion<br/>
#0	2	Individual demonstrates that they have plenty of commits in the project Git log.<br/>
#Marker feedback: Git commits not shown in video.<br/>
#0	2	Individual demonstrates that they have written useful commit messages.<br/>
#Marker feedback: Git commits not shown in video.<br/>
#1	1	Individual demonstrates that they have been contributing to the repository throughout the duration of the project.<br/>
